Sandy is a college student who is on her way to class. Today was not a good day. She tripped over a can on the way to class. She  was 10 minutes late.
She fell asleep during the exam that was worth 100% of the class grade. It was a nightmare that
was coming true.

On her way back to her dorm, Sandy dropped a notebook that she was holding into a puddle that was on the ground. As she bent down to pick it up, someone bumped into her from
behind and she tripped, dropping the textbook that she had been also holding. As she got up and picked up her stuff, she wondered when this terrible nightmare day would end.
