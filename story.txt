Sandy is a college student who is on her way to class. Today was not a good day. She tripped over a can on the way to class. She  was 10 minutes late.
She fell asleep during the exam that was worth 100% of the class grade. It was a nightmare that
was coming true.

On her way back to her dorm, Sandy dropped a notebook that she was holding into a puddle that was on the ground. As she bent down to pick it up, someone bumped into her from
behind and she tripped, dropping the textbook that she had been also holding. As she got up and picked up her stuff, she wondered when this terrible nightmare day would end.

Luckily her mom had mistakenly bought 20 hairdryers for her the weekend before. She made good use of her mothers mistake by using all those hairdryers to dry out her textbooks. But, she did not think about what would happen to the electricty with all those hairdyers running at the same time.

Suddenly the power went out and Sandy was left grasping in the dark. She saw the lights from the window. Everyone else had power. Was it just her? Did she do this? As she moved closer to the windows to investigate, she tripped and hit the sofa. Her world went black. She opened her eyes. 
It was just a dream, it seemed. She opened her eyes and the room was glowing. She was lying on the sofa that she fell on in the dream. No wonder it was so life like, the entire dream. There was no way that actually happened right? But then she heard her mom scream from the other side of the house.

The End.
